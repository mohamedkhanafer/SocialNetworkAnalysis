In this repository I share a detailed project done for a course about Social Network Analysis at IE HST.

# 1. Madrid's Bike Sharing System compared to New York's and Montreal's
With the high increase in bicycle sharing systems in most large cities around the world, I found it interesting to analyze and compare some of the best established ones. I here use a different approach that would ususally be applied on such data. Indeed, I use a Network Analysis to try finding insights.



In this project, I focus on turning bike trips into  networks that we can analyze. Thus throughout the study, I established networks in which the nodes are the bike stations throughout the city, and the edges are the flows of the trips in each direction between the stations. And the edges are weighted by the number of trips carried out by the bikes on that edge. 

The goal of this research would be to try finding similarities and differences in the networks of these cities' systems as well as finding interesting patterns within each city. 

The different cities analyzed here are Montreal, New York, and Madrid which respectively started operating those bicycle sharing systems in 2009, 2013, and 2014.
